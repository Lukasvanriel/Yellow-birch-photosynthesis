**Description of the data: VanRiel_20230926_coefficients**

These data are the photosynthetic output parameters of the analysis performed by the plantecophys package [@duursma2015] on the photosynthesis data that can be found in the raw data folder. The analyses were carried out in September of 2023 by Lukas Van Riel.

**Variable descriptions:**

-   *Curve:* Character variable identifying the different trees.

-   *Vcmax:* Maximum rate of carboxylation. Continuous variable in units of $\mu$molm^-2^s^-1^ .

-   *Jmax:* Maximum rate of electron transport. Continuous variable in units of $\mu$molm^-2^s^-1^ .

-   *Rd:* Dark respiration rate. Continuous variable in units of $\mu$molm^-2^s^-1^ .

-   *adult*: categorical variable (2 levels; 0 and 1) describing whether the individual is a juvenile (0) or an adult (1). Juvenile trees have a diameter at breast height between 1 and 9 cm while adults have any diameter above 9 cm.
