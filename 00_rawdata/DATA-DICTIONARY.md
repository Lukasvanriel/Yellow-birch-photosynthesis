**Description of the data: VanRiel_LI-COR6400_20230920**

These data were collected with a LI-COR6400 System by applying the RaCiR technique [@stinziano2017] to different plots along along a latitudinal gradient in Quebec, Canada (between 46 째N and 48 째N located close to 74.5 째W). There were 5 sites with 3 plots each. At each plot, 5 adult and 5 juvenile yellow birch trees were sampled. These data were collected by Lukas Van Riel and Francois Girard in August 2023.

**Variable descriptions:**

-   *Curve:* Character variable identifying the different trees that were measured.

-   *Ci:* Abbreviation for internal CO~2~. Continuous variable describing internal CO~2~ concentrations at which each measurement was taken in units of ppm.

-   *Photo:* Continuous variable describing the net photosynthesis rate in response to the internal CO~2~ concentration in units of $\mu$molm^-2^s^-1^ .

-   *Tleaf:* continuous variable describing the temperature at the leaf surface during measurements in units of 째C.

-   *adult:* categorical variable (2 levels; 0 and 1) describing whether the individual is a juvenile (0) or an adult (1). Juvenile trees have a diameter at breast height between 1 and 9 cm while adults have any diameter above 9 cm.

-   *PARi:* The photosynthetic photon flux density that was set during measurements. Continuous variable in units of mu\$molm^-2^s^-1^ .
